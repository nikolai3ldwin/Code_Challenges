# Code Challenges

This repository contains several Python code challenges and their solutions, as well as a project for automating image clicking on webpages.

#### To run any of these scripts or projects, simply execute the corresponding Python file in your terminal or command prompt.

## regex_phone_number_finder.py

This script reads the contents of a file named 'lorem_ipsum_phone_numbers.txt' located in the working directory and finds all occurrences of phone numbers in the format `xxx-xxx-xxxx` using regular expressions. The found phone numbers are returned as a list.

## mean_std_calc.py

This script generates a list of random numbers with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 1 using the `random.gauss()` function. It then calculates the mean and standard deviation of the generated list using the mathematical formulas for mean and standard deviation. The calculated mean and standard deviation are returned as a tuple.

## dict_key_assertions.py

This script demonstrates the behavior of immutable objects (in this case, strings) and their memory addresses when passed to a function. It uses the `id()` function to get the memory addresses of the objects before and after passing them to a function. The script asserts that the memory address of the immutable object (string) changes after reassigning a value to it within the function, while the memory address of the mutable object (number) remains the same.

## Squares_Generator.py

This script defines a Python generator function `squares()` that generates a continuous sequence of squares of integers starting from 0. The `squares_caller()` function takes an integer `n` as input and prints the first `n` squares generated by the `squares()` generator.

## Image Clicking Automation

This project provides a Python script that can automate the process of clicking on specific images on a webpage using computer vision techniques. It utilizes the `pyautogui` library for mouse control, the `opencv-python` library for image processing and OCR, and the `PIL` library for working with images and colors.

The `click_if_present()` function takes a `matching` argument, which is the name of the image file (without the extension) stored in the `system_files` directory. It loads the image, captures the current screen, and uses template matching to find the location of the image on the screen. If the image is found, it clicks on the location using `pyautogui.click()`.

To run this project, simply execute the Python script and provide the appropriate image file names in the `system_files` directory.

## Object Introspection Script

Object Introspection:
Introspection is the automatic process of discovering an object's attributes.
Python offers this capability through the built-in `dir()` function.
When `dir()` takes an object as an argument, it returns:
"an alphabetized list of names comprising (some of) the attributes of the given object, and of attributes reachable from it."

The function returns a list of all the method names of a string object that start with the 'is' prefix
(the first three such method names are shown below):
`['isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isascii', ...]`
